** This repo is folked from https://github.com/bkoester/aim-analytics**
I did some analysis using their data for one of my online course and answer some my own questions. The analysis was initially written in .r then I rewrite it in .sas.

The main program is Aim_Analysis.sas and I include some of .sas files include macros I use to do initial EDA.
The student.course.csv and student.record.csv are the original format of two data tables that were used in the analysis.



You can find the original readme file below:

This contains data and code for sharing as it is discussed in the UMich AIM-Analytics seminar series. The Wiki (link on the right side of this page) describes the usage and gives examples.

1) PLA-MOOC: Code from the Pratical Learning Analytics MOOC, discussed first on 5-Oct-2015. Clicking on the folder above will allow you to view the materials associated with this project. Supporting information, samples, etc. can be found in the PLA-MOOC page of the wiki.

2) NETWORK: Example code (11-Jan-2016) that will use the MOOC student-course and student-record data to plot heatmaps, chordDiagrams, and networks.
